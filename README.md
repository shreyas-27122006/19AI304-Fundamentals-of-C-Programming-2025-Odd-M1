# Ex.No:1
  Build a C program to demonstrate the usage of different types of literals: integer, float, character, and string.  
# Date : 
# Aim:
To build a C program that prints integer, float,character, and string literals on the console using the printf() function.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3: 
  Inside the main() function, use printf() to display each literal along with its size in bytes using sizeof() :
  
   3.1 Integer literal (e.g., 10) using `%d`
   
   3.2 Float literal (e.g., 3.14) using `%f`
   
   3.3 Character literal (e.g., 'A') using `%c`
   
   3.4 String literal (e.g., "Hello C") using `%s`
   
### Step 4:

# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3: 
  Inside main(), declare and initialize variables of types int, float, double, and char.

# Ex.No:4
  Build a C program to perform arithmetic and bitwise operations on two integers entered by the user. The program should display: Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. Bitwise operations: AND, OR, XOR, left shift, right shift, and NOT.
# Date : 
# Aim:
  To build a C program that takes two integers as input and demonstrates the arithmetic and bitwise operations, displaying the results of each operation.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3: 
  Declare two integer variables a and b.
### Step 4: 
   Prompt the user to enter two integers and read the input using scanf().
### Step 5:    
   Perform arithmetic operations on a and b:
   #### Sum (a + b)
   #### Difference (a - b)
   #### Product (a * b)
   #### Quotient (a / b)
